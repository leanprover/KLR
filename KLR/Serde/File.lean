We would like all of our CBOR encoded files to be easily identifiable as KLR
files, both for our tools and for third-party tools that understand CBOR. The
CBOR specification defines a special tag value (55799), which indicates that
what follows is a CBOR encoded value. This special value is meant to help
decoders identify CBOR data streams. When this value is encoded as a CBOR
tagged value, it will be three bytes, the 16-bit tag indicator (0xd9), followed
by the big-endian representation of 55799 (0xd9 0xf7):

  0xd9 0xd9 0xf7 ,

and this three byte sequence can be used to identify a CBOR file. Quoting the
specification:

  The serialization of this tag's head is 0xd9d9f7, which does not appear to be
  in use as a distinguishing mark for any frequently used file types. In
  particular, 0xd9d9f7 is not a valid start of a Unicode text in any Unicode
  encoding if it is followed by a valid CBOR data item.

We leverage this by specifically marking our `KLRFile` structure with a tag of
0xd9, and changing the `mk` constructor to have tag 0xf7. When this is
converted to a 16-bit tag by our `cborTag` function (see Serde.Basic), we end
up with 0xd9d9f7, the "self-described CBOR" marker.

The `KLRFile` structure contains a semantic version number, and nothing else so
that tools unaware of our format can read the header. Hence, every KLR file
starts with:

  0xd9 0xd9 0xf7 0x83 major minor patch
  |    |    |    |
  |    |    |    +-- list of length 3
  |    +----+-- 55799 tag value (self-described CBOR)
  +-- CBOR code for 16-bit tagged value

This is all handled automatically by our derived instances.

@[serde tag = 0xd9]
structure KLRFile where
  major : Nat := 0  -- TODO come up with a way to manage versions
  minor : Nat := 0
  patch : Nat := 9

attribute [serde tag = 0xf7] KLRFile.mk

deriving instance ToCBOR for KLRFile

#guard
  (toCBOR { : KLRFile}).take 4 == .mk #[0xd9, 0xd9, 0xf7, 0x83]

Immediately following the KLRFile structure we place a KLRMetaData structure.
We are careful to choose a tag value (0xeb00) that is unassigned according to:

  https://www.iana.org/assignments/cbor-tags/cbor-tags.xhtml

Because everything is contained within this tagged value, we do not have to
worry about avoiding assigned tags on our other (internal) types.

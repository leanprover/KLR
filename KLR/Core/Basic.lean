# Abstract syntax of Core NKL language

This language is the result of "tracing", and is used as the
portable format, a.k.a. Kernel Language Representation (KLR).

A tensor shape is a list of the sizes of each dimension of the tensor. By
convention, the first dimension is always the "partition" dimension, and the
remaining dimensions are "free" dimensions. When laid out in memory, the
partition dimension will correspond to the memory partition.

An Address represents a region of memory. Each address has a memory type, and
the starting location and size of the memory region. The memory regions are
always two-dimensional and the start and size are expressed in bytes. The
starting location can be omitted to have the compiler choose this for you.

An address may have a parent, in which case the start is relative to the
parent's start location. This allows the user to declare a memory region with
no start address, but containing subregions with specific relative positions.

The Address structure is represented as a "pointer" term during tracing.

TensorName represents a tensor in memory at runtime. Each runtime tensor has a
dtype, shape, and address. The address size must be large enough to hold the
tensor.

Basic indexing elements: integers and slices.
These are used for basic indexing, such as:
  t[1, 2]
  t[0:10, :]
  t[5, 0:10:2]

The tracing process will generate Indexes relative to a given shape,
and therefore we do not have `None` or `...` as possibilities.

Access pattern elements.

These are used for HW-native indexing which consists of an offset and a list of
access pattern pairs. Each pair specifies a step size and the number of steps
to take. The first changes the slowest, and the last pair changes the fastest.
For example, in the list of pairs:

  [ (3,2), (1,3) ]

the first pair will produce the values 0,3 and the second pair will produce the
values 0,1,2. Added together, the pairs produce the values:

  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

which is equivalent to the basic index [0:2,0:3] for a standard tensor layout.

Complete access patterns

A complete access pattern has a list of APPairs, a number of partitions, and an
offset. In NKI, the first access pattern pair corresponds to the partition
dimension, and the step size of this first pair must be one. So, in the
complete access pattern, we only store the `num` field of the first pair. The
offset field allows for an arbitrary offset to be applied to each partition.

Put together, a complete access pattern would be written as:

  t[[ offset, (1, parNum), (step1,num1), (step2,num2), ... ]]

With a meaning of:

  forall p < parNum, x < num1, y < num2, ...
    offset + p + x * step1 + y * step2 + ...

The elements generated above are multiplied by the dtype size of the tensor to
get the final memory addresses.
